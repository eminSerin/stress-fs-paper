# stress-fs-paper

Code repository for the paper "Linking brain structure to stress reactivity: Cingulate surface area predicts acute cortisol responses."

The repository is organized as follows:
- 00_organize_data: Scripts for preparing data for analysis.
- 01_palm: Scripts for PALM analysis.
- 02_whole-brain: Scripts for FreeSurfer's whole-brain vertex-wise analysis.
- 03_stress-ml: Scripts for predicting cortisol increase from structural brain measures.

Each directory contains ordered steps. Additionally, before beginning, you need to set your own working directory in the scripts.
